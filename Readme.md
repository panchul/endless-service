# Endless Service

It is a sandbox with some Android HowTos.

Forked from a neat project showing how to run an Android Foreground Service,
thanks to https://github.com/robertohuertasm/endless-service.

Adding miscellaneous bells and whistles as I figure out how to do them.
Some things never committed(too messy to be of particular use and no time to clean up).
But I try to at least keep the links that were relevant.
